  title: Azure Data Manager for Energy - Workflow Service API
  version: 2.0.5
  description: "Workflow Service API is a wrapper API on existing orchestrator services (e.g., Airflow) tailored for domain-specific workflow needs within the Azure Data Manager for Energy. It handles operational tasks like starting, stopping, and pausing workflows, as well as their creation and maintenance.\n ## Key Points:\n **Workflow** - A collection of steps executed in a specific order to perform meaningful tasks, such as ingesting a CSV file. Each workflow is uniquely identified by a `workflowId` and represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n \n **Workflow Run** - A single execution instance of a workflow. Each workflow run has a unique `runId`."
